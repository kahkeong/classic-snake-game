## **Motivation**
Snake game has just the right amount of GUI and simple mechanism so I chose this as my first ever side project! Hope this will be the starting point of my journey into creating more side projects to improve my skills.
## **How to play**
- Press any key to start the game.
- Press p to pause the game while the game is in progress.
- Press space when you lose and want to restart the game.
- Use arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
## **How to run**
#### Running the game with python
- Change directory to the downloaded project
- Ensure python is set in your windows path
- Type 'python main.py' at your command prompt to run it
#### Running the game without python
- An executable file is included and it was generated with [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)
- Note that this is only tested with a Windows machine.
