Hey everyone, this is my first ever side project! </br>
Hope this will be the starting point of my journey into creating more side projects to improve my skills. </br>
The classic snake game is written in python with the use of pygame framework. </br>
As I believe there are a lot of classic snake game project out there, </br>
I coded this myself in order to have better learning experience with bare minimum reference to pygame documentation.

Following are the instructions for the game
- Press any key to start the game.
- Press p to pause the game while the game is in progress.
- Press space when you lose and want to restart the game.
- Use arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.
